Duotone is a great effect that has, while predating digital software, seen a boost in popularity in the last fews years. The Spotify ad campaign that was plasted all across London a few years comes to mind.

I'm going to run through a simple method to create a Duotone effect by using a gradient map on a black and white image.

First we'll need a black and white image. We don't want to be limited to just using black and white images. So let's reuse our desaturated function we covered in the [first part of this series](/p/2023-06-webgl-filters-part-1) to create one.

```glsl
vec4 desaturated(vec4 color) {
  // sRGB colorspace luminosity factor
  vec3 lumFactor = vec3(0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722);
  vec3 rgb = vec3(dot(color, luminosityFactor));
  return vec4(rgb, color.a);
}
```

Now we have a black and white (desaturated) image, we want to map black to our low color and white to our high color.

```glsl
vec4 duotone(vec4 fragColor, vec4 lowcolor, vec4 highcolor) {
  vec4 desaturated = desaturated(fragColor);
  return mix(lowcolor, highcolor, desaturated);
}
```
