Build up "component" slowly talking about each part

Spent some time searching for a useWebGL hook, nothing fully filled my needs

- lean into the many escape hatches of React 
- initalise webgl setup logic in useEffect
- useLayoutEffect will lead to next.js issues
- not reinitalise you're setup webgl logic on state updates
- useRef or useState for data store data?
- resize listener
- auto size from canvas' size. let's us control styling with CSS
- fullscreen support, window.innerHeight 

These are approaches I've found myself using. If you have any suggestions please hit me up as I'd love to improve these. 

In the next article we'll take a look at adding the common uniforms you'll see in [The book of shaders]() and [shadertoy.com]().
