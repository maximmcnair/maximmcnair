Less colors equals less bits of data, which means less memory

Windows ** only had ** of  

Even with the memory non-limits  of today the aesthetics of dithering are still a popular style

8 bits per rgb channel is millions of colors
many devices at the time were limited to ** bytes of color

- render gradient which has been quantized to a specific amount of bites of color

NOTE: A bit is the most basic unit of information in computing. It's a 0 or 1. A group of 8 bits is a byte.

To reduce the size of an image we can reduce the color palette of that image so it can use higher levels of compression. We use a process called **quantization** for this. We define a palette of colors, then we loop through each pixel and find the closest color in our palette to reduce that color with.

This leads to banding in the image, this is the
