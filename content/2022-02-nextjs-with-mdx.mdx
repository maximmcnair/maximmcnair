I'm intending to start writing a lot more articles on this site, so for this rebuild I wanted to keep the layout completely separate from the article content. This will enable me to update the site layout without updating the articles themselves.

I want to be able to write content in markdown, but also to embed React components and have code syntax highlighting throughout my articles.

### Article content with Markdown

Step one is to handle the rendering of our content. We'll use a number of packages to handle all the specific features we need.

- [next-mdx-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-mdx-remote) Markdown rendering with React component support
- [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) YAML meta data support
- [react-highlight](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-highlight) Code syntax highlighting, with easy theming

This will enable us to write our articles like the following:

````
---
title: Hello
slug: home
---

Article content in **markdown.**

## Component example
<ReactComponent />

More content in **markdown.**

```ts
function syntaxHightlight(){
  return '';
}
``
````

### How it'll work

The articles are stored in a directory and we'll use a NextJS template to render the layout of the page with an `<article>` to contain the articles content.

When a user visits a url such as `/p/article-name`, we'll search our content directory for an article with a filename that matches the url.

With our directory structure looking like the following:

- /content/ will contain mdx posts
- /pages/p/[slug].tsx will contain template

### Listing our articles

For the homepage we want to show a list of articles. We'll need access each content file and process the meta data for the title to render. For this we need the following helper functions:

```ts
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import matter from "gray-matter";
import { Post } from "types";

// Our /content directory, which contains multiple .mdx files
const contentDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), "content");

export async function getPostSlugs(): Promise<string[]> {
  // Get all the files in our content directory
  const slugs = fs.readdirSync(contentDirectory);
  // Return a list without their file extension
  return slugs.map((s) => s.replace(".mdx", ""));
}

export async function getPost(slug: string): Promise<Post> {
  // Get file content
  const postPath = path.join(contentDirectory, `${slug}.mdx`);
  const postSource = fs.readFileSync(postPath);
  // Extract meta data
  const { content, data: meta } = matter(postSource);
  return {
    slug,
    content,
    meta,
  };
}

export async function getPosts(): Promise<Post[]> {
  const slugs = await getPostSlugs();
  // Loop through each file and return it's meta data and content
  return await Promise.all(
    slugs.map(async (slug) => {
      return await getPost(slug);
    })
  );
}
```

With our article content processed in the previous helpers, we can easily fetch our articles when will build our site with `getStaticProps` and then pass our articles to our Home page as props

**/pages/index.ts**

```ts
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const posts = await getPosts();
  return { props: { posts } };
}

const Home: NextPage = ({ posts }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {posts.map(({ slug, meta }) => (
        <a href={`/p/${slug}`} key={slug}>
          <h2>{meta.title}</h2>
        </a>
      ))}
    </>
  );
};
```

## Rendering our article

Now that our users can follow a link to our article. We can use the url slug to get the correct article content, and then render this content with `<MDXRemote />`.

Note that since we want to embed React components we need to do this server side with `getStaticProps` or `getInitialProps`.

**/pages/p/[slug].ts**

```ts
export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
  // Get all our article's and return each one slug as an available page url
  const slugs: string[] = await getPostSlugs();
  const paths = slugs.map((slug) => {
    return {
      params: { slug },
    };
  });
  return { paths, fallback: "blocking" };
};

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async (context) => {
  // Use our url slug to get the correct article content
  const slug = context?.params?.slug || "";
  const { content, meta } = await getPost(String(slug) || "");
  // Use MDXRemote's serialize to get our correct embedded React components
  const mdx = await serialize(content);

  return {
    props: {
      meta,
      mdx,
    },
  };
};

const Post: NextPage = ({ meta, mdx }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{meta?.title}</h1>
      <MDXRemote {...mdx} components={{ pre: Highlight }} />
    </>
  );
};

export default Post;
```
