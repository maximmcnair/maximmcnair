### What is pixelation?

Pixelation is normally a side-effect of displaying an image at a higher resolution than it has data for. While this is generally seen as an issue, we can also mimic this effect for aesthetic reasons.

In GLSL, we can achieve this effect by rounding our x/y values when fetching our texel data. Rounding by a specific ratio will control the size of the pixelation.

```glsl
vec4 pixelate(float size, vec2 uv) {
  float dx = size / u_resolution.x;
  float dy = size / u_resolution.y;
  float x = dx * (floor(uv.x / dx) + 0.5);
  float y = dy * (floor(uv.y / dy) + 0.5);
  return texture(
    u_image,
    vec2(x, y)
  );
}

void main() {
  // map uv between 0 -> 1
	vec2 uv = gl_FragCoord.xy/u_resolution;
  vec4 texel = texture(u_image, uv);
  outColor = texel;

  outColor = pixelate(60.0, uv);
}
```

In the next article, we'll take a look into [thresholding](/p/webgl-thresholding) our color data.
