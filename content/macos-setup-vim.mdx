While I've been an Mac user for over 20 years, I made the switch over to Arch Linux with i3 a few years ago and couldn't be happier with it. However for work I've had to come back to MacOS, and I've found the default OS setup quite lacking. Some of the main issues I've struggled with are:
- Focus on the mouse being the dominant controller
- Apple + Tab only showing one icon for each type of app. No way to select between two instances of Firefox for example. 
- Misson Control's default setting to rearrange Spaces based on recent usage. This seems like a major anti pattern for spacial memory

Some of the key features I miss from i3 are:
- Binding each "Space" to a number and switching with ctrl + 1 etc.
- Default programs to open on a specific Space e.g. always open slack on Space3
- Automatic spacing/positioning of application windows to fill ratios of screen
- Keyboard shortcuts for resizing windows, moving between windows and switching to another space
