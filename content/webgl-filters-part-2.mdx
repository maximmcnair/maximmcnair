- camera is already doing it behind the scenes

- ~Hue~

Effects:
- Grain
- Pixelation
- Vignette
- Blur
- Duotone

We can handle these in the browser with WebGL and glsl fragment shaders. I'm not going to go into the WebGL side of things here as it's too big for a single article. I've used raw WebGL for these experiment but these shaders would easily work with Three.js or another WebGL abstraction.

Since we are increasing the brightness by addition will eventually make every pixel white, Exposure uses multiplication so keeps the darks darker.
